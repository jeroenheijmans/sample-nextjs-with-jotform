# Sample NextJS Application with Jotform

This is a sample NextJS application which demonstrates integration of [Jotform](https://www.jotform.com/), a paid SAAS tool to create web forms.

## Running

Install dependencies and run the code:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Possibly more instructions are forthcoming.
To integrate your own Jotform forms you'll need to change the code a bit.
